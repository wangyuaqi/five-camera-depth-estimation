CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:48 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0002 is not set: Logical target names must be globally unique.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0002" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error: Files to be generated by multiple different commands: "/home/wangyuanqi/code/code/sgm_12_30/new_camera_code/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/sgm.dir/src/sgm_generated_n_hamming_cost.cu.o.Debug.cmake"
CMake Warning (dev) at /home/Jet/clion-2018.3.4/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.13/Modules/FindCUDA.cmake:1870 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0003 should be set before this line.  Add code such as

    if(COMMAND cmake_policy)
      cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW)
    endif(COMMAND cmake_policy)

  as early as possible but after the most recent call to
  cmake_minimum_required or cmake_policy(VERSION).  This warning appears
  because target "sgm" links to some libraries for which the linker must
  search:

    -lpthread, dl

  and other libraries with known full path:

    /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart_static.a
    /home/wangyuanqi/opencv-3.4.1/new_build/lib/libopencv_dnn.so.3.4.1

  CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
  case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
  compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
  or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
  more information.
